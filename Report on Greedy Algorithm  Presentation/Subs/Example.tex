Now, we shall look at an example.\\ \\ 
Suppose, there is a very rich man who has infinite supply of 500 Taka ,100 Taka  and 50 Taka notes. He has a friend who needs some money. He asks for 650 Taka but in minimum number of notes.\\
If there was no restriction, he could have given it in many ways.
In any combination of 500, 100 and 50 taka that sums 650. \\
But they don't satisfy the condition of minimum note number.\\

We can use Greedy approach to solve this problem.\\
First, we shall find the biggest note less than 650, which is 500 Taka. So, the sum is 500.\\
Then, we shall find the biggest note less than 650-500 = 150, which is 100 Taka. Now the sum is 600.\\
Finally we shall choose the note which is less or equals to 650-600 = 50 Taka.\\
And that is our answer. One 500 Taka, One 100 Taka, One 50 Taka.\\
\\
For every iteration we chose note of largest value that does not take us past the amount to be given. \\
This algorithm is Greedy Algorithm.\\
