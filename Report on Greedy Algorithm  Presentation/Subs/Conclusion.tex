\begin{itemize}
    \item Greedy algorithms aim for global optimality by iteratively making a locally optimal decision.
    \item To show correctness, typically need to show
    
\begin{itemize}
    \item  The algorithm produces a legal answer, and
    \item The algorithm produces an optimal answer.

\end{itemize}

    \item Often use “greedy stays ahead” to show optimality
\end{itemize}
