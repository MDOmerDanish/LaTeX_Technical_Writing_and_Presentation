A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem
solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with
the intent of finding a global optimum.

	In another words, A greedy algorithm 
constructs an object X one step at a time,
at each step choosing the locally best option.
	Then constructs the globally best object by
repeatedly choosing the locally best option.

Greedy Algorithm is simple, easy to implement and runs fast
But very often they don't provide a globally optimum.
