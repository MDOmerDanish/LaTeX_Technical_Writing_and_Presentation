Greedy algorithms have several drawbacks:


\begin{description}
\item[ Hard to design:]  Once you have found the  right greedy approach, designing 
greedy algorithms can be easy. However, finding the right approach can be hard.
\item[Hard to verify:] Showing a greedy algorithm is correct often requires a 
nuanced argument.

\end{description}

Now, we shall look at an example where greedy algorithm will provide us wrong answer.\\
We know from greedy algorithm that if we choose  local optimal at each stage it will  form a global optimum. It is true in some cases but not for all time.\\

Let's have a look at the figure above .
\subfile{Subs/Graph.tex}	 
We want to find the maximum value of addition from root node to leaf node.
%\newpage
~~~\\ \\
\subfile{Subs/GreedySolution.tex} ~~~\\
If we approach according to greedy algorithm we get a value that is 3+7+11 = 20, which is not maximum value of addition.

~~~\\ \\ \\
%\newpage
\subfile{Subs/RightSolution.tex} ~~~\\
Where the actual optimal solution is 3+4+20 = 27

That means in this exmple greedy algorithm is unable to find global optimum.
