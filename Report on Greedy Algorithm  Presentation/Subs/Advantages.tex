A greedy algorithm is a mathematical process that looks for simple, 
	easy-to-implement solutions to complex, multi-step problems by deciding 
	which next step will provide the most obvious benefit.



\begin{description}
\item[Simplicity:]  Greedy algorithms are often
easier to describe and code up than other algorithms.
\item[Efficiency:] Greedy algorithms can often be
implemented more efficiently than other algorithms.
